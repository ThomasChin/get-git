# get-git
This is an application that allows you to search for users across all of GitHub by name. You can then click on their icon
to get more information on them such as their hireability, location, followers, and repos, as well as a link to their
own github profile on Github.com.

This app was built using the React Context API to separate state and actions from the App component.

To run dev build:
$ npm start

This app is deployed on Netlify at this url: https://get-git.netlify.com/
